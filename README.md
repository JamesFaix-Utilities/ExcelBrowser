# Excel Browser

Excel Browser is a desktop application for Microsoft Excel powerusers.  It provides a compact display of all running Excel instances and their workbooks, sheets, and windows.  

This addresses several UI shortcomings in Excel:
 1. Until 2010, Excel had a rather inconvenient multiple-document interface (MDI), in which each which each workbook window was opened inside a master Excel window.  Minimized workbooks were easy to lose, changed order frequently, and were too small to display full file names.
 2. Starting in 2013, Excel has no MDI at all.  All workbooks are in separate windows, and ALT+TAB or the Windows taskbar must be used to manage workbooks, which are often full of other files and applications.
 3. Within a workbook, sheet names are listed horizontally, which results in lots of sheet tab scrolling, especially if sheet names are long.
 4. Excel does not provide much support for keeping track of different windows of the same workbook.
